# pageoflinks
 Modified "page of links" (w/ own links and own style) project originally by my professor Tyler Finck. Original can be accessed at [github.com/sursly/pageoflinks](https://www.github.com/sursly/pageoflinks). 


 One page of links. 

I created this breath of fresh air since my online connections are sprawling (for better or for worse). It is no nonsense – zero webfonts, no graphics other than a few emojis, even the CSS is just over 100 lines – for the sake of speed and functionality. The goal: this page was built to take people somewhere else. This readme is a larger file size than both the html + css combined.
